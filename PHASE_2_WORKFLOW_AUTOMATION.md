# Phase 2: LangChain Workflow Automation & Orchestration

## Overview
Phase 2 extends the natural language capabilities into intelligent workflow automation, allowing complex multi-step operations with safety checks and error recovery.

## Key Features

### 1. **Workflow Orchestrator**
```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates complex multi-step Tableau operations."""
    
    async def process_complex_request(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Process complex requests like 'Clean up Finance project'."""
        
        # Parse intent and break down into steps
        workflow_plan = await self._analyze_request(user_input)
        
        # Get user confirmation for destructive operations
        if workflow_plan.has_destructive_operations:
            confirmation = await self._request_confirmation(workflow_plan)
            if not confirmation:
                return "Operation cancelled by user"
        
        # Execute workflow with progress tracking
        results = await self._execute_workflow(workflow_plan)
        
        return self._format_workflow_results(results)
```

### 2. **Complex Workflow Examples**

#### Content Cleanup Automation
```python
# User: "Clean up the Finance project - archive old workbooks and consolidate datasources"
workflow_steps = [
    {"analyze": "Find workbooks not accessed in 90+ days"},
    {"confirm": "Show list of 15 workbooks to be archived"},
    {"execute": "Move old workbooks to Archive project"},
    {"analyze": "Find duplicate/similar datasources"},
    {"suggest": "Consolidation opportunities for 8 datasources"},
    {"execute": "Merge compatible datasources with user approval"}
]
```

#### User Migration Workflow
```python
# User: "Migrate John's content when he leaves the Marketing team"
workflow_steps = [
    {"inventory": "List all content owned by John"},
    {"analyze": "Determine content importance and usage"},
    {"plan": "Suggest new owners based on content type and team structure"},
    {"transfer": "Reassign ownership with proper notifications"},
    {"cleanup": "Update permissions and remove John's access"},
    {"audit": "Generate migration report for compliance"}
]
```

#### Permission Audit & Optimization
```python
# User: "Audit permissions for sensitive workbooks and create access report"
workflow_steps = [
    {"identify": "Find workbooks tagged as 'sensitive' or 'confidential'"},
    {"analyze": "Check current permissions vs. expected access patterns"},
    {"detect": "Flag unusual permissions or overly broad access"},
    {"recommend": "Suggest permission optimizations"},
    {"report": "Generate comprehensive audit report"},
    {"schedule": "Set up recurring permission reviews"}
]
```

### 3. **Safety & Validation Features**

#### Pre-execution Validation
```python
class WorkflowValidator:
    """Validates workflows before execution."""
    
    async def validate_workflow(self, workflow: Workflow) -> ValidationResult:
        checks = [
            self._check_destructive_operations(),
            self._validate_permissions(),
            self._check_dependencies(),
            self._estimate_impact(),
            self._verify_rollback_capability()
        ]
        return await self._run_all_checks(checks)
```

#### Smart Confirmations
```python
# Instead of blindly executing, ask intelligent questions:
"I found 23 workbooks not accessed in 90+ days. Archive all, or would you like to review the list first?"

"This will affect 145 users across 3 projects. Proceed with permission changes?"

"Detected potential data lineage impact. Should I analyze dependencies first?"
```

### 4. **Error Recovery & Rollback**

#### Transaction-like Behavior
```python
class WorkflowTransaction:
    """Provides rollback capabilities for complex operations."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = []
        self.rollback_stack = []
    
    async def execute_with_rollback(self, operation):
        """Execute operation and prepare rollback if needed."""
        try:
            result = await operation.execute()
            self.rollback_stack.append(operation.create_rollback())
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            await self.rollback_all()
            raise WorkflowException(f"Operation failed, rolled back: {e}")
```

### 5. **Progress Tracking & Reporting**

#### Real-time Progress Updates
```python
# User sees progress like:
"""
🔄 Workflow Progress: Clean up Finance project
✅ Step 1/5: Analyzed 847 workbooks (found 23 candidates for archival)
✅ Step 2/5: User confirmed archival list
🔄 Step 3/5: Moving workbooks to Archive project (12/23 complete)
⏳ Step 4/5: Pending - Analyze datasource consolidation
⏳ Step 5/5: Pending - Generate cleanup report
"""
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2A: Basic Workflow Orchestration
1. **Workflow Parser** - Break complex requests into steps
2. **Safety Validator** - Check for destructive operations
3. **Progress Tracker** - Show workflow status
4. **Basic Rollback** - Undo simple operations

### Phase 2B: Advanced Orchestration  
1. **Smart Confirmations** - Context-aware approval requests
2. **Dependency Analysis** - Understand content relationships
3. **Impact Assessment** - Predict consequences of changes
4. **Advanced Rollback** - Full transaction support

### Phase 2C: Workflow Templates
1. **Common Patterns** - Pre-built workflows for frequent operations
2. **Customizable Templates** - User-defined workflow patterns
3. **Learning System** - Improve workflows based on usage
4. **Integration Hooks** - Connect with external systems

## Example Implementation

```python
# Enhanced LangChain integration for Phase 2
class AdvancedTableauOrchestrator:
    
    async def handle_complex_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Parse complex intent
        workflow = await self.intent_parser.parse_workflow_intent(query)
        
        if workflow.complexity > SIMPLE_THRESHOLD:
            # Multi-step workflow required
            plan = await self.workflow_planner.create_execution_plan(workflow)
            
            # Safety check
            if plan.has_risks():
                confirmation = await self.get_user_confirmation(plan.risks)
                if not confirmation:
                    return "Workflow cancelled for safety"
            
            # Execute with progress tracking
            return await self.workflow_executor.execute_with_tracking(plan)
        else:
            # Simple operation, use Phase 1 logic
            return await self.simple_query_processor.process(query)

# Usage examples:
orchestrator = AdvancedTableauOrchestrator(tableau_client, llm)

# Complex workflow
result = await orchestrator.handle_complex_query(
    "Archive all unused workbooks from Q2, update permissions for remaining content, and notify project owners"
)

# Smart batch operation  
result = await orchestrator.handle_complex_query(
    "Find all workbooks using deprecated datasources and migrate them to the new consolidated datasource"
)
```
